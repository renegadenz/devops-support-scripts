# DevOps Support Scripts
This repository, created by James Mead (DevOps Engineer), contains a collection of scripts that can be used to streamline various DevOps tasks on AWS. The scripts are organized into separate subdirectories, each with its own documentation and usage instructions. Here's a brief overview of the scripts:

* instance-selector: A script for connecting to an EC2 instance using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.
* deploy-cloudformation: A script for deploying CloudFormation stacks with a separate variables file using Docker.
* install-python: A script for installing Python using Pyenv.
* install-eks-support: A script for installing the tools required for working with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
* rotate-iam-keys: A script for rotating IAM access keys on a local machine. I've also added a few lambdas

To use these scripts, navigate to the appropriate subdirectory and follow the instructions in the README file. Be sure to read the documentation and modify the scripts as necessary to suit your specific needs.

# Notes
I will add more scripts over time.
